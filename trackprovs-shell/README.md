## trackprovs

`trackprovs` contains a set of utils for tracking content providers in DHT based
services

Currently, `trackprovs` supports IPFS and Dat and in the future it will include
MainlineDHT and other P2P networks that do not use DHTs (e.g. peer-assisted
CDNs). 

The goal of `trackprovs` is to study how much metadata and behavior data peers
are leaking when using current P2P networks.
